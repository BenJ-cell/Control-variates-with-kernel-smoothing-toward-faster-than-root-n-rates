# Control-variates-with-kernel-smoothing-toward-faster-than-root-n-rates
This document is the summary of our work on Control variates with Kernel smoothing. The goal of this project is to see if Kernel smoothing enables us to be more efficient than other control variates in approximating the integral : \begin{equation}     \displaystyle I = \int g f d\lambda \end{equation}. Where $f$ is a density function on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $g$ a function on $\mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. As we might not be able to draw random variables directly from $f$, we consider a sampler $q$ of the density $f$.  \paragraph{ }  In a first part we create conventional control variates and compute the approximation of $I$. Then we will be taking the Kernel smoothing estimators as control variates (in order to control the variance ~\cite{article1}). In a third time we will implement the OLS to those control variables in order to select the best $q$, the ultimate goal being to compare the efficiency of the different control variables.
